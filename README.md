# Planetary Dynamics using Barnes-Hut tree algrotihm
Program to simulate planetary dynamics using the Barnes-Hut tree algorithm and
the brute force method. Main goal of the project was to produce animations and to show
the speedup offered by the BH method over the brute force method. See the ppt presentation
in root for more details. Barnes-Hut algorithm implemented in C#, animations made using MatPlotLib in Python.
